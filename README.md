  - **Cloud IAM**: Manages access control and permissions, providing secure and fine-grained management of resources.

- **GitHub**: Serves as the backbone for our codebase management.
  - **Repositories**: Hosts organized code for both the frontend and backend, ensuring version control and collaborative development.
